PIXEL GAUGE
==========

Pixel Gauge is a jquery plug-in to measure distances in pixels online. As usual, you must download pxgauge.js and pxgauge.css to the folder of the page you are prototyping and link to them in the html to get faster an idea of how tall, wide, taller or wider an element must be.
You do that by moving pairs of horizontal and vertical rays, whose color can be chosen among a few of them. After roughly dragging the rays you can fine-adjust it position with the arrow keys.
