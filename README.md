PIXEL GAUGE
==========

Pixel Gauge is an html snippet to measure distances in pixels online. You can insert it at the end of the body of a page you are prototyping to get faster an idea of how tall, wide, taller or wider an element must be.
You do that by moving pairs of horizontal and vertical rays, whose color can be chosen among a few of them. After roughly dragging the rays you can fine-adjust it position with the arrow keys.
